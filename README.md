# Simple auth form project

## Demo
It is live at [Github Pages](https://maksimdegtyarev.github.io/simple-auth-form/).

## Reason
Was developed as a test project to show [them](https://github.com/evilmartians), that I am able to create handy and nice authentication form with email and password, using SPA framework, but without ready-to-go components.

## Using
As usual, you can start it by typing
```sh
npm start
```
